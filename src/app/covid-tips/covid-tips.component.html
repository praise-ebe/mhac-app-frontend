                    children are much more likely to do what we ask if we give them positive instructions and lots of praise

            All children misbehave. It is normal when children are tired, hungry, afraid,

            more effective than hitting or shouting</p>

            <li>Try to stay calm when giving the consequence.</li>
            <li>Make sure you can follow through with the
                consequence. For example, taking away a
                teenager's phone for a week is hard to enforce.
                Taking it away for one hour is more realistic.</li>
            <li>Once the consequence is over, give your child
                a chance to do something good, and praise
                them for it.</li>

            Be willing to talk. They will already have heard something. Silence and secrets do not protect our
            children.
            Honesty and openness do. Think about how much they will understand. You know them best.

        <h2>Be open and listen</h2>
        <p>Allow your child to talk freely. Ask them open questions
            and find out how much they already know.</p>
        <h2>Be honest</h2>
        <p>Always answer their questions truthfully. Think about how
            old your child is and how much they can understand.</p>
        <h2>Be supportive</h2>
        <p>Your child may be scared or confused. Give them space
            to share how they are feeling and let them know you are
            there for them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cyan-bg">
        <h2>It is OK not to
            know the answers</h2>
        <p>It is fine to say "We don't know,
            but we are working on it; or we
            don't know, but we think." Use
            this as an opportunity to learn
            something new with your child!
        </p>
        <h2>Heroes not bullies</h2>
        <p>Explain that COVID-19 has nothing to do with
            the way someone looks, where they are from, or
            what language they speak. Tell your child that
            we can be compassionate to people who are
            sick and those who are caring for them.
            Look for stories of people who are working to
            stop the outbreak and are caring for sick people.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="purple-bg">
        <h2>End on a good note</h2>
        <p>Check to see if your child is okay. Remind them
            that you care and that they can they can talk to
            you anytime. Then do something fun together!</p>
